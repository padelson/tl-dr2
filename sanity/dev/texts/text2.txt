Chinese dissidents in the United States generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing's privileged trading status targeting state- owned firms, not complete revocation, dissident leaders said here Thursday.

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that a US Senate vote calling for a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia was a matter of internal politics in the United States.
