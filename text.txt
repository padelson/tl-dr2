Romario has no doubts about who the biggest stars of this summer's World Cup finals will be: "Roberto Baggio, Hristo Stoichkov, Faustino Asprilla and me, of course," he responds.

A buddhist in catholic Italy, a shy, undemonstrative man from a nation of extroverts: it is not surprising that Roberto Baggio is also an original on the field.
